- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @tomas-feith, and I'm a student at EPFL, doing my Master's in Computational Science and Engineering.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Image Processing/Computer Vision applications, either the "old-fashioned" way or with Machine Learning to help out.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via tsfeith@gmail.com, and I usually reply quickly.

PS: If this profile seems dead maybe I've been working under my college account, so check out @tsfeith-epfl for more recente work!
