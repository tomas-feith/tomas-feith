- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @tomas-feith, and I'm a student at EPFL, doing my Master's in Computational Science and Engineering.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in Machine Learning applications, and lately I've been working on joint applications of NLP and graphs in various contexts!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via tsfeith@gmail.com.

PS: If this profile seems stale maybe I've been working under my college account, so check out @tsfeith-epfl for more recent work!
